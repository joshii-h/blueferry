# OpenRC

BlueFerry's native packages target systemd. On OpenRC, which is outside the
CI package matrix and has no package recipe here, the backend works without a
service manager. D-Bus activation works with any OpenRC version; only the
optional user service needs OpenRC 0.62 or newer with a `pam_openrc` user
session.

## Default: D-Bus activation

No init script is needed. Install the packaged
`io.weirdware.BlueFerry.service` activation file in
`/usr/share/dbus-1/services/`. Without systemd activation the session bus
ignores its `SystemdService=` line and starts `Exec=/usr/bin/blueferry run`
itself, just as it starts BlueZ's `obexd`.

The backend detects that no service manager runs it and manages its lifecycle
through the session bus:

- **Start**: a client calls `GetStatus`, and the bus activates the daemon.
- **Stop and restart** (after pairing, forgetting a phone, or a package
  upgrade): BlueFerry asks the bus daemon which process owns
  `io.weirdware.BlueFerry` and checks that it runs as the same user. It
  sends that process `SIGTERM` through a pidfd, re-checking the owner first,
  and waits up to 180 seconds for the name to be released. If needed it then
  sends `SIGKILL` and waits 5 more seconds, like the systemd unit and the
  OpenRC script. A restart then activates a new daemon. It does not scan
  processes and does not use root.

Unlike the systemd unit's `ConditionPathExists=`, D-Bus activation also starts
the daemon before a phone is paired.

## Optional: OpenRC user service

Use `packaging/openrc/blueferry` **only** if your desktop session uses the
session bus at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus`, for example because the OpenRC user
`dbus` service provides it. Check with `echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` in the
desktop.

> **Do not create a user service** on desktops started through
> `dbus-run-session` or `dbus-launch`, such as Plasma under greetd or SDDM,
> whose bus address is `unix:path=/tmp/dbus-…`. Do not add the user `dbus`
> service there either. It would start a second session bus, the service's
> daemon would sit on that bus, and D-Bus activation would start a second
> daemon on the desktop bus, with both competing for BlueZ. D-Bus activation
> alone is correct there.

Install the script as `/etc/user/init.d/blueferry` (mode 0755) or
`~/.config/rc/init.d/blueferry`, then:

```sh
rc-update --user add blueferry default
rc-service --user blueferry start
```

Once the service is enabled in one of your runlevels or running, and the
desktop's `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` is `unix:path=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus`,
BlueFerry uses `rc-service --user blueferry start|restart|stop` instead of
D-Bus activation. If the desktop uses another bus, it logs a warning, ignores
the service, and uses D-Bus activation.

- `start_pre` refuses to start until `~/.config/blueferry/local.env` exists,
  standing in for `ConditionPathExists=`. OpenRC has no silent skip, so this
  appears as a failed start with a hint.
- The daemon runs `${BLUEFERRY_BIN:-/usr/bin/blueferry} run` under
  `supervise-daemon`. Set `BLUEFERRY_BIN` in `~/.config/rc/conf.d/blueferry`
  for other install locations.
- `supervise-daemon` respawns the daemon 5 seconds after **any** exit, not
  only failures. That covers exit status 75, the daemon's restart request
  after a package upgrade, and also exit status 0. More than five exits within
  two minutes stop respawning.
- Output is appended to
  `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/blueferry/daemon.log` (mode 0600). OpenRC
  does not rotate it.
- If a client asks for BlueFerry before the service has started, D-Bus
  activation wins the race and the service's daemon fails to acquire the bus
  name. Because `pam_openrc` waits for the user's `boot` runlevel, adding
  `dbus` and `blueferry` to that runlevel should avoid this. This has not been
  tested.

### Reduced hardening

The systemd unit confines the daemon with `ProtectSystem=strict`,
`PrivateDevices=`, `PrivateTmp=`, `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX`,
`RestrictNamespaces=`, `SystemCallArchitectures=native`, and related
directives. Neither D-Bus activation nor OpenRC offers an equivalent, so the
daemon runs with the user's ordinary filesystem, device, and network access.
The init script keeps `umask 077` and `no_new_privs`.

## BlueZ experimental mode

iPhone system notifications need BlueZ 5.86 or newer running `bluetoothd -E`.
Arch and Fedora packages install a systemd drop-in for this. On OpenRC an
administrator enables it once in `/etc/conf.d/bluetooth`:

- Gentoo: `BLUETOOTH_OPTS="-E"`
- Alpine, whose init script has no options variable: `command_args="-E"`

Then run `sudo rc-service bluetooth restart`, which briefly disconnects all
Bluetooth devices. Until then, BlueFerry pairs for messages and contacts and
shows these steps instead of an activation button.

BlueFerry finds the running `bluetoothd` through `/proc` and looks for `-E` or
`--experimental`. Known limits: a bundled short option such as `-nE` is not
recognized, and with `/proc` mounted `hidepid=1` or `2` the daemon is invisible
and experimental mode reads as inactive.

## Bluetooth device class

Pairing needs the adapter's Class of Device set to A/V Hands-Free, and the
daemon repairs it whenever it drifts, for example after Bluetooth restarts.
systemd packages run the argument-validated helper
`/usr/lib/blueferry/blueferry-set-cod` as a sandboxed system unit that a
narrow Polkit rule lets active local sessions start. Without systemd,
BlueFerry runs the same helper as
`sudo -n -- /usr/lib/blueferry/blueferry-set-cod N`, where the adapter index
is its only argument. `-n` never prompts, so an administrator authorizes it
with a sudoers rule (edit with `visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/blueferry` and adjust
the group):

```
%wheel ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/lib/blueferry/blueferry-set-cod ^[0-9]+$
```

The `^[0-9]+$` argument pattern needs sudo 1.9.10 or newer; the helper also
rejects anything but one decimal index. Without the rule, setup explains how
to add it or how to run the helper once by hand, for example
`sudo /usr/lib/blueferry/blueferry-set-cod 0` for `hci0`.

Notes and trade-offs:

- The rule runs a short shell script as full root. Unlike the systemd unit it
  has no capability bounding set or sandbox, and it applies to every session
  of the listed users, not only active local ones. It can still only set the
  class of an existing adapter to 4/8.
- `sudo -n` also succeeds without a rule while a sudo timestamp from a recent
  `sudo` in the same terminal is cached. Authorization then comes from that
  cache, not from BlueFerry.
- After sudo refuses, the daemon stops retrying until bluetoothd restarts, so
  a missing rule does not fill the authentication log every minute.
- The optional OpenRC user service sets `no_new_privs`, which makes sudo
  impossible for the daemon. BlueFerry detects this and does not call sudo.
  Pairing, which runs from the desktop session, and the D-Bus-activated daemon
  are unaffected. With the user service, either rerun the helper after
  Bluetooth restarts or set `no_new_privs=""` in
  `~/.config/rc/conf.d/blueferry`, giving up that hardening measure.
- Setting file capabilities on `blueferry-set-cod` has no effect, because the
  kernel ignores them on scripts. Granting them to `btmgmt` would give every
  local user all Bluetooth management commands, so it is not supported.

## WirePlumber

BlueFerry restarts WirePlumber after changing its phone-audio policy only from
the pairing flow, and only when WirePlumber runs as an OpenRC user service.
The daemon itself never blocks on `rc-service`. Desktops that start PipeWire
through a session launcher, such as `gentoo-pipewire-launcher`, are left
alone; the log then asks you to restart WirePlumber or log in again.
