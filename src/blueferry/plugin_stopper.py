"""Stop a plugin process that still runs code from a replaced or removed venv.

Plugins are D-Bus activated and some (servers such as LocalSend or the
Shortcuts bridge) never exit on their own. After an update, a removal or
disabling, the process that owns the plugin's bus name would keep running
the old code from a venv that is gone. :class:`BusPluginStopper` asks the
session bus who owns the name, checks that the owner runs as this user and
that its executable or interpreter arguments lie inside one of the plugin's
old venvs, then sends SIGTERM and waits briefly. It never sends SIGKILL: a
process that ignores SIGTERM is reported and left alone. D-Bus activation
starts the new code on next use.

Every call blocks (bus round trips, the wait), so it runs where the rest of
:mod:`blueferry.plugin_manager` runs: the CLI or a worker thread, never the
GLib main loop. The bus and ``/proc`` are injectable for tests.
