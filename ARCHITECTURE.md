# Architecture

BlueFerry is a per-user Bluetooth bridge from a paired iPhone to the Linux
desktop, with several interchangeable presentation clients. One unprivileged
backend daemon owns every long-lived iPhone profile session (MAP, PBAP, ANCS)
and all persistent message state; clients talk to it over a private session
D-Bus API.

## Module map

All paths are relative to `src/blueferry/` unless noted.

### Backend core

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `daemon.py` | Orchestrates lifecycle: publishes D-Bus, then starts Bluetooth, supervisors, state, and sinks; builds `BackendDependencies`. |
| `backend_operations.py` | Toolkit- and transport-neutral application operations: validation, thread routing, and policy. |
| `dbus_service.py` | Session D-Bus adapter (`Messages1`/`Events1`/`Presence1`) that maps operations to wire types; claims the bus name. |

| `dbus_call.py` | Asynchronous dbus-python calls with an explicit input signature (`call_async`), plus typed `ay`/`a{sv}` builders. |
| `gio_dbus.py` | `GioBus` seam over `Gio.DBusConnection`: typed asynchronous `call` and `subscribe`, D-Bus-named `DBusCallError`. Target for the GDBus migration. |
| `protocol.py` | Stable D-Bus identifiers and the API-generation compatibility check. |
| `event_dispatcher.py` | Builds messages from MAP/ANCS events and fans them out to persistence, desktop, and D-Bus sinks. |

contract.

## Process boundaries

- `blueferry-backend` owns MAP, PBAP, ANCS, contact resolution, thread
  identity, history retention, notification policy, and the private D-Bus API.
  It runs unprivileged and has no sudo command path.
- GTK, Qt, TUI, Quickshell, and the CLI message commands are replaceable
  clients. They receive opaque thread keys and cannot construct different
  recipients for an existing thread.
- Within the backend, `dbus_service` is only a wire adapter over
  `backend_operations`; `daemon` orchestrates lifecycle, `event_dispatcher`
  owns fan-out, and `profile_supervisor` owns profile transitions. Its worker,
  session, and timer protocols make races testable without BlueZ.
- PBAP transport and parsing (`contacts`) stay separate from persistence
  (`contact_repository`). The opt-in call history follows the same split
  (`call_history`, `call_history_repository`, `call_history_sync`) and exists
  in the daemon only when `BLUEFERRY_CALL_HISTORY_ENABLED` is set.

## D-Bus calls inside the daemon

Everything in the daemon shares one GLib main loop, so a call that waits for
a reply stalls BlueZ signals, timers, and every client meanwhile.

- Calls from loop code are asynchronous. New code uses `gio_dbus.GioBus`:
  arguments are a `GLib.Variant` built from an explicit type string, the
  reply type is declared and checked by GDBus, and failures arrive as
  `DBusCallError` with the usual D-Bus error name. Inject the `GioBus`
  (constructor argument) so tests can fake it; `phone_audio_route.py` is the
  reference.
- Existing dbus-python code that is not migrated yet uses
  `dbus_call.call_async`, which always passes the input signature. Never pass
  a bare `{}`/`[]` to a proxy fetched with `introspect=False`: dbus-python
  cannot type it and raises `ValueError` before sending.
- Blocking work (`time.sleep`, `subprocess.run`, OBEX transfers, slow SQLite
  opens) runs on the OBEX worker or a helper process, never on the loop.
- `tools/lint_mainloop.py` enforces this for modules the daemon imports
  (run in CI and by `tests/test_lint_mainloop.py`). Deliberate exceptions go
  in its `ALLOWLIST` with a reason; pre-existing violations are tracked in
  `KNOWN_DEBT` and leave it only with their fix.

### GDBus migration order

One module per change, behaviour-identical, tests green; no big bang. Start
with small clients whose calls are already asynchronous (mechanical port),
then the `KNOWN_DEBT` entries that block today:

1. `obex/mns_watch.py`, `calls/ofono.py`, `sinks/otp_clipboard.py`, then
   `tether.py`/`tether_backends.py` (already asynchronous through the same
   `AsyncBus` seam `PhoneAudioRoute` used, so the port is mechanical).
2. `sinks/libnotify.py`: `Notify` becomes asynchronous; the popup tracker
   records the id in the reply handler.
3. `bearer_supervisor.py` (`_read_bluez_connected`, `_prefer_bluez`) and
   `bluez_setup.current_cod`.
4. `ams/client.py`, then `ancs/client.py`: ANCS needs its subscribe path
   (`StartNotify`/`StopNotify`/`GetManagedObjects`) turned into an
   asynchronous state machine like AMS first.
5. `dbus_security.CallerGuard` and `dbus_service`: caller credentials become
   an asynchronous lookup before dispatch; this touches the service adapter
   and goes last among loop code.

Worker-thread OBEX code and the setup CLI may stay on dbus-python; they never
run on the loop. Signal watches (`add_signal_receiver`) still make a blocking
`AddMatch` per watch in dbus-python; GDBus subscriptions do not.

## D-Bus API and compatibility

- `Messages1` carries commands and unicast snapshots; `Events1` carries
  content-free live coordination. `Presence1` holds desktop-presence
  controls that are not messaging (the opt-in away lock); their state is
  reported through `Messages1.GetStatus`, and the compatibility check runs
  through `Messages1` on the same owner. Identifiers live in `protocol.py`.
- `Calls1` is the optional, default-off HFP call interface. It is always
  exported; with `BLUEFERRY_CALLS_ENABLED` unset its methods fail with
  `CallsDisabled`, and a missing oFono or modem yields `CallsUnavailable`.
  Its `CallsChanged` invalidation on `Events1` has no arguments; caller
  numbers and names are only returned by the rate-limited `ListCalls`.
  Dialing has its own strict quota. Adding it did not change the API
  generation.
  content-free live coordination. The opt-in `Media1` interface returns the
  now-playing snapshot and sends validated media commands; its
  `NowPlayingChanged` invalidation on `Events1` has no arguments.
  Identifiers live in `protocol.py`.
- `Tether1` is a separate, optional interface for Bluetooth PAN tethering:
  `Connect`, `Disconnect`, and `GetState` return a small JSON state (state,
  interface name, backend, error token; never IP configuration), and its
  own content-free `TetherChanged` signal invalidates it. It is outside the
  messaging generation, so clients treat a missing interface as "not
  offered" rather than as an incompatible daemon. Commands have their own
  `tether` rate bucket; `GetState` shares the status bucket.
- `data/io.weirdware.BlueFerry.xml` is canonical, installed under
  `dbus-1/interfaces`, and checked against the service's dbus-python
  decorators.
- `GetStatus.api_version` is the messaging compatibility generation
  (currently 2, roster-bound replies), independent of the package release.
  Additive compatible changes keep the generation; incompatible changes need a
  new interface suffix, never a silent contract change.
- Shared clients check the generation on the same owner-bound proxy they
  invoke. A verified daemon is remembered by its unique bus name, which a
  replacement never reuses, so it is checked once rather than per call. Missing, malformed, or
  different generations prompt the user to update before any read or
  mutation. Lifecycle recovery alone reads status unchecked so it can restart
  an outdated daemon first.
- Payloads cross the bus as JSON and are decoded immediately by `client_wire`
  into `models`, which retain unknown fields for forward compatibility.
- **What never crosses the bus:** `HistoryChanged` carries only a daemon-local
  revision, `StatusChanged` and `CallHistoryChanged` have no arguments, and
  `OpenMessageRequested` carries only a bounded opaque MAP handle. Call
  records are read only through the authenticated `ListCallHistory`. Message records, sender
  identities, ANCS fields, contacts, and connectivity details are never
  broadcast. Expected errors use stable, length-bounded names under
  `io.weirdware.BlueFerry.Error`; unexpected exceptions and OBEX details stay
  in the daemon log.
- Every public method checks the caller's UID against the backend's and
  applies per-connection plus daemon-wide quotas, with separate limits for
  sends, contact sync, storage unlock, destructive operations, reads,
  status, media reads, and media commands. Reconnecting does not reset daemon-wide limits. Snapshot sizes,
  query text, and replies are bounded.
- `ListThreads` fits an 8 MiB budget by keeping the newest contiguous tail of
  each thread, capped at 500 messages per thread, and includes retained
  starred threads outside the normal 2,000-event window. `messages_truncated`
  signals truncation. These limits never delete events or change reply
  recipients.

### Group replies and roster tokens

- The backend owns reply routing. Reply addresses always come from the
  backend projection.
- Group replies use `SendToThreadChecked`, which binds approval to the exact
  roster and roster-warning token the client displayed. The backend rejects
  stale tokens, even if another client already confirmed the new roster.
  Legacy `SendToThread` still works for direct threads only.
- Tokens are computed by `recipients.group_confirmation_token` over the exact
  displayed addresses, formatting included. Only transport destinations are
  normalized.
- `models.Thread` derives unread counts, approval tokens, and roster-warning
  keys from existing backend fields, so they need no new API generation. Qt
  and the Quickshell bridge serialize them for QML so JavaScript does not
  recompute them.
- Group sender labels are display-only and never affect identity or routing.

## Client architecture

### Shared layer

- All Python transports decode through `client_wire`. Scheduling
  (synchronous, GLib, Qt, Textual) is toolkit-specific.
- `conversation_state` holds snapshot and reply logic for GTK, Qt, and TUI.
  Snapshots distinguish an untouched source, a failed read, and an empty
  history. A failed status read marks the backend unavailable but keeps the
  last history. Storage state is unknown until the first successful read.
- The reply planner validates the roster token held by the confirmation
  dialog. GTK and TUI keep the dialog's token across refreshes.
- `onboarding` derives the first-run stage from configuration, read-only
  controller capabilities (never vendor names), the selected bond, and backend
  status. Raw hardware capability is kept separate from the saved target's
  ANCS policy, so a compatibility pairing can reach `ready-without-ancs`.
- No presentation main loop blocks on the backend, BlueZ, or systemd.
- User-visible Python strings go through gettext, QML strings through `qsTr`.
  `po/POTFILES.in` is the translation inventory.

### Per-toolkit notes

- **GTK** (GTK4/libadwaita): snapshot reads are serialized on a private bus
  connection owned by a worker, and sends use dbus-python reply handlers.
  Asynchronous results feed `ConversationState`. Onboarding uses
  `onboarding.OnboardingState`.
- **Qt/Kirigami**: `BridgeController` serializes work in a QThreadPool,
  coalesces `Events1` invalidations, and keeps `ConversationState` across
  refreshes and sends. The pending group dialog is bound to its original
  conversation and draft. `Main.qml` handles only navigation. Settings
  dialogs belong to the window so pairing prompts survive closing the page.
- **TUI** (Textual): shares the snapshot loader with Qt. Blocking calls run in
  workers with thread-owned D-Bus connections. Signals trigger coalesced
  refreshes, with a bounded periodic fallback. Every native backend package
  includes it. DEB/RPM bundle Textual in a private vendor directory that only
  packaged entry points activate.
- **Quickshell**: QML has no generic D-Bus client, so one persistent
  `quickshell_bridge` process handles all messaging, contact, status, and
  preference requests over stdin. Private data never goes in process argv.
  It sends a `host` event at startup, and its `status` replies also carry
  `bluetooth_restart_command`: the host's BlueZ restart command (`""` when
  unknown), used in the ANCS repair hint even while the daemon is down.
  Setup uses the separate short-lived `pairing-*` helpers, because setup
  happens before the daemon is available. Quickshell sends the displayed
  roster token so the backend can reject stale routes. Superseded or
  cancelled setup results are ignored, and each helper has a deadline.

### Known duplication

The Quickshell client does not share all of its semantics with the Python
layer:

- `data/quickshell/OnboardingState.qml` re-implements stage derivation and
  pending iPhone setup tasks rather than using `onboarding.py`.
- `qt/qml/ConversationLogic.qml`, used by both Qt and Quickshell,
  re-implements thread lookup, roster-warning deduplication, and participant
  parsing (written to match `recipients.participant_lines`). Quickshell uses no
  `conversation_state` logic. Python/QML behavior tests cover parts of these
  contracts, such as serialized tokens and participant parsing.

A change to these rules has to be made in both places.

## Pairing and setup

- **Layers:** `pair_setup` is the low-level boundary. `setup_client` exposes
  typed operations to GTK, Qt, and the CLI wizard, and Quickshell reaches the
  same operations through the `pairing-*` JSON helpers. Setup writes the
  selected MAC and ANCS policy to user configuration and asks systemd for
  privileged steps.
- **Two independent axes** (`pairing_policy`) replace a table of device
  quirks:
  - *Delivery mode*: `full` when ANCS is supported and selected. Otherwise
    compatibility mode persists `BLUEFERRY_ANCS_ENABLED=false`, MAP/PBAP is the
    success boundary, and the daemon never enables LE/ANCS for that target.
  - *Authentication*: normally `iphone-initiated-connect`, where a
    device-scoped agent is registered and `Device1.Connect()` lets the iPhone
    start authentication. `explicit-device-pair` (`Device1.Pair()`) is an
    override for controllers that cancel Connect-first.
- **Confirmation is mandatory.** `SetupClient.complete()` requires a
  confirmation callback. GTK and Qt run the agent in a helper isolated from
  GLib and D-Bus, and its stdout is reserved for the JSON interaction
  protocol. The Quickshell pairing and forget helpers require an explicit
  interactive flag and a positive approval over the line protocol. No caller
  can fall through to a desktop Bluetooth agent.
- The temporary agent stays registered until the daemon's first MAP/PBAP
  attempt. Success means MAP/PBAP works end to end, not only that a bond
  exists on the Linux side.
- ANCS solicitation is separate from ANCS connection policy. It is broadcast
  after the Classic bond settles, in compatibility mode too, because older iOS
  uses it to expose the MAP/PBAP permission toggles.
- Pairing reports record the resolved policy, controller capability, ordered
  timeline, build ID, and full source SHA, with addresses and home paths
  scrubbed.

## Bluetooth supervision and recovery

- **Worker model:** one dedicated worker with its own session-bus connection
  serializes every blocking MAP/PBAP operation. Its backlog is bounded, and
  results return through GLib before touching daemon state. Slow D-Bus
  methods use deferred replies, so status and BlueZ events stay dispatchable
  during transfers. Wallet operations use a separate worker (120 s
  cancellable deadline) and never occupy the Bluetooth worker.
- **Profiles:** connectivity moves through explicit states (initializing,
  connecting, ready, degraded, reconnecting, authorization-required,
  map-connection-refused, stopping). Retries happen every 5 s until the first
  success and every 15 s afterwards. MAP and PBAP recover independently, and
  full readiness requires both. `Connection refused (111)` is kept so clients
  can explain that another computer may hold the phone's single MAP
  connection.
- **Bearers:** `bearer_supervisor` keeps BR/EDR and LE connected, independent
  of desktop applets. In full mode a missing LE bearer holds back MAP/PBAP
  reconnects. Compatibility mode leaves LE disabled. Classic reconnects back
  off exponentially (up to 10 min without a live LE link). After three failed
  attempts with no sign of the phone (no LE link, no RSSI from a discovery in
  the last two minutes), or when BlueZ reports that the phone closed the
  Classic link itself (`Bearer.BREDR1.Disconnected` with `Reason.Remote`,
  e.g. Bluetooth switched off on the iPhone), the supervisor stops paging
  and probes only every 10 min until an inbound link, LE or a discovery
  sighting shows the phone again. Paging an absent phone once hung
  bluetoothd in `l2cap_chan_connect` (kernel 7.2.8), so fewer pages matter.
  `Messages1.ReconnectPhone()` (own `reconnect` rate bucket, 6/min) clears
  the backoff and pages once; it never starts a second attempt while one is
  running. GetStatus reports `phone_reconnect_state`
  (`connected`/`connecting`/`waiting`/`unreachable`), `phone_reconnect_paused`
  and `phone_reconnect_next_in_sec`; `reconnect_view.py` turns them into the
  same texts for every client.
- **Media (opt-in):** `ams/client` never dials. It follows the bearer
  supervisor's LE observations and BlueZ owner changes, subscribes after the
  link settles, and resets without `StopNotify` on loss. `media` owns the
  command policy; the optional `mpris` adapter owns its bus name only while a
  player is active. MPRIS broadcasts metadata session-wide by design, which
  is why it is a separate opt-in from `Media1`.
- **Stale LE bond:** the same supervisor watches `Bearer.LE1.Disconnected`
  (polled transitions as a fallback). Five LE drops within a minute, each
  from a link younger than 15 s and with no usable link in between, set
  `le_bond_suspect`. The supervisor then stops its own LE dials and resets,
  and recovery skips the adapter power cycle. An authorized ANCS round trip,
  a held link, a new bond, or a new bluetoothd generation clears it.
  `GetStatus` carries the flag, the drop count, and a fixed reason token.
  `doctor`, pairing reports, Qt, and the TUI explain the remedy.
- **Solicitation:** `solicitation_supervisor` keeps the advertisement on air
  until MAP/PBAP and an ANCS Control Point round trip are both healthy. It
  re-registers the advertisement if BlueZ releases it or changes owner.
- **Class-of-Device:** this setting is volatile. The daemon checks it at
  startup, on BlueZ owner change, and periodically. On drift it runs one fixed
  systemd helper that can only set the validated adapter to A/V Hands-Free, as
  permitted by a narrow Polkit rule. No general `btmgmt` or systemd access is
  exposed. A freshly restarted bluetoothd can answer with Busy (0x0a) or hide
  the adapter briefly, so a failed startup or restart check is retried after
  2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 s before falling back to the periodic check.
  Without systemd, the same helper runs only through `sudo -n` and an
  administrator-installed sudoers rule. BlueFerry never prompts for or stores
  credentials, skips sudo under `no_new_privs`, and pauses repair (including
  the quick retries) after a refusal until bluetoothd restarts.
- **Recovery:** `bluetooth_recovery` performs a last-resort power cycle of the
  selected controller only. It runs after a sustained ANCS outage on a setup
  that previously worked, tries an LE-only reset first, and allows one cycle
  per outage. Only sustained, verified ANCS health rearms it, and cycles are
  at least an hour apart. Limits and pending restoration survive restarts.
  It skips adapters in use by other devices, discovery, or transfers. User
  details are in `README.md`.
- **Tethering** (`tether`) is an explicit user action layered on the Classic
  link the bearer supervisor owns. `Connect` is refused until that link is
  up, and the code never calls `Device1`/`Bearer` `Connect`/`Disconnect` or
  `ConnectProfile`, only `Network1` or NetworkManager, so it cannot fight the
  supervisor over the ACL link or reorder MAP-first startup (a fake bus and
  a source check enforce this). With NetworkManager the daemon reuses the
  phone's existing `bluetooth`/`panu` profile untouched (its own, else the
  most recently used) or creates a per-user, non-autoconnecting one, and
  NetworkManager runs DHCP; without it the daemon brings up the `bnep` link
  only and never spawns a DHCP client. A `Network1` property watch reports
  link loss and adopts links started elsewhere; stopping an adopted link
  finishes only once BlueZ confirms it is down. Only a tether whose network
  interface exists (with an unknown interface, for at most ten minutes)
  marks the adapter busy for recovery, and a BlueZ owner loss resets it.
  Automatic tethering exists only behind `BLUEFERRY_TETHER_AUTOCONNECT`,
  waits for MAP/PBAP, backs off after refusals, never chases links another
  tool started, and pauses after an explicit disconnect, including a
  NetworkManager deactivation with reason `USER_DISCONNECTED`.
- **Proximity lock** (opt-in) reads only the bearer supervisor's cached
  BR/EDR and LE state. It arms after an observed connection, locks once after
  a continuous grace period, and is inhibited by suspend, adapter power-off,
  discovery, recovery, and a forgotten phone. It never unlocks: Bluetooth
  presence is not an authentication factor. Locking is asynchronous
  (`org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.Lock`, then logind `Session.Lock`). It is
  configured through `Presence1.SetProximityLock`, and `GetStatus` reports
  only its state keys through the existing argument-free `StatusChanged`.
- **Read receipts** go through `read_receipts`, which delays MAP write-back so
  ANCS can still fetch group metadata. Local reads take effect immediately.

## Optional phone calls

- `calls.controller` only observes and drives oFono on the system bus; BlueZ
  and PipeWire/WirePlumber own the HFP profile and SCO audio. oFono is an
  optional runtime service: `ServiceUnknown` means "unavailable", retried
  every 60 s and immediately on an `org.ofono` owner change. Calls carry
  NO_AUTO_START, so BlueFerry never makes the bus activate oFono. oFono's
  shipped D-Bus policy only admits root and `at_console`; `AccessDenied` is
  also "unavailable" and logged once.
- `Dial` accepts plain numbers only (`+` and digits); `*`/`#` service codes
  are rejected so a caller cannot reconfigure the phone (for example call
  forwarding). Keypad symbols remain available as DTMF on an active call.
- The modem must end in the configured iPhone's `dev_…` path and be of type
  `hfp`; the configured adapter wins, then Online, then Powered. iOS needs
  `Powered=true`, a confirming `PropertyChanged`, then `Online=true`.
  `Powered` is only requested while the Classic bearer is connected, so an
  absent phone is not paged; bearer status changes poke the controller.
- Discovery and bring-up back off 1/2/4/8/15 s, then poll every 30 s; a
  30 s watchdog retries a modem that never confirms. Replies and signals
  carry a generation, so an oFono restart or modem removal drops stale
  state; control replies still reach their D-Bus caller.
- Call events go to local desktop sinks only (`handle_call`); they are not
  persisted and nothing about them is broadcast except `CallsChanged`.
- Phone status: from `Powered=true` on (oFono creates these atoms in
  `hfp_pre_sim`, independent of `Online`), the controller watches `Handsfree`
  and `NetworkRegistration` (only when listed in the modem's `Interfaces`)
  and reads them with an asynchronous `GetProperties`. A failed read other
  than a vanished interface (typically `InProgress` while oFono queries
  `AT+CNUM`) is retried once after 30 s. Values are cleared on
  `Powered=false`, interface or modem removal, an oFono owner change, and
  stop. They are additive `GetStatus` keys (`null` when unknown); calls-state
  and phone-status changes emit one coalesced, argument-free `StatusChanged`
  per main-loop iteration. The opt-in low-battery warning goes to sinks
  through `handle_phone_battery_low` and fires once per discharge cycle (and
  again after a daemon restart).

## Storage and privacy

- **Remote input is untrusted.** Names, vCards, notification text,
  recipients, and timestamps from the iPhone are parsed and validated before
  use. Parsers, transfers, contacts, replies, and retained payloads all have
  explicit limits (`limits.py`).
- **Identity:** normalized phone or email addresses are identities, and
  contact names are display metadata only.
- **Group routing:** named-group ANCS notifications start as read-only
  threads. Only the backend retains a user-supplied route, and every observed
  sender must remain in it. A sender outside the route raises a roster-change
  warning and disables replies. Routes are local and never modify iPhone
  groups. They are preferences in `settings.json`, not history events, so
  retention and the bounded conversation window never discard a route that
  is still in use. Two named groups with the same name share a key because ANCS has no
  conversation ID. Versioned keys preserve spelling (NFC, trimmed), and editing
  a roster does not change the key. Legacy name-folded keys remain aliases
  only when history shows a single spelling, and reading history never
  rewrites the database.
- **Encryption at rest:** history, the contact cache, and the opt-in call
  history live in `0700` directories as `0600` SQLite files. Sensitive records, including event kind,
  timestamp, and content, are encrypted with AES-256-GCM under one random key
  held by the Secret Service through libsecret. Clients never handle the key,
  and keyring lookup attributes are non-sensitive. Starred keys, saved group
  routes, and confirmed rosters in `settings.json` are encrypted per
  collection.
- **Fail closed:** passive startup only loads a key from an already unlocked
  collection and never prompts. If the key is missing or wrong, or plaintext
  is unframed, storage becomes unavailable without deleting records while live
  delivery continues. Only an explicit client action may create or unlock the
  key. History writes are transactional, and a monotonic revision invalidates
  the projection.
- **Contact photos** are opt-in (`BLUEFERRY_CONTACT_PHOTOS`). The daemon keeps
  inline JPEG/PNG bytes within size limits. It checks the declared canvas by
  reading the header and never decodes pixels. It stores the raw bytes
  AES-GCM-sealed in a BLOB next to the contact records, in the same
  transaction, and erases them at startup when the option is off. The photo
  table is created only when a sync stores a photo, and the off-path check is
  read-only, so a profile that never opted in keeps the upstream schema.
  Releases without this feature don't clear the table, so the README asks
  users to disable the option and start the backend once before downgrading.
  Photo reads open the database read-only with a short lock timeout. While a
  sync holds the database, or a hot journal from a crash awaits rollback, they
  return `NotReady`, which clients retry. Clients get them through
  `GetContactPhoto(address) -> ay`. It has its own rate-limit bucket (with a
  higher daemon-wide window, so several clients can fill their lists) and
  returns a photo only for an unambiguous address. Clients drop cached photos
  when the content-free `contact_photo_revision` status key changes.
  Presentation processes decode the images with toolkit loaders. Notification
  icons are temporary `image-path` files in the runtime directory.
- **ANCS content:** the app is identified before any content is requested.
  The default policy never fetches content from other apps. The opt-in `all`
  policy applies exact bundle-ID allow/block rules first and delivers content
  only to an ephemeral popup sink, never retained or broadcast. Apple Messages
  keeps only the fields needed for group correlation.
- **Notification click rules** map an exact bundle ID to an `http(s)` URL or
  a desktop-entry ID. They are fixed user configuration: the popup's content
  is never interpolated into a target, and nothing is passed to a shell. The
  store, the D-Bus method, the daemon's spawn, the helper's command line, and
  the final Gio launch each revalidate the target. The daemon starts a
  helper process (never launching on its GLib loop or inside its sandbox);
  under systemd the helper asks the user manager for a transient
  `app-blueferry-open-*.service` so the app runs outside the backend's
  cgroup and restrictions, then launches through Gio with the notification
  server's activation token. Removing a rule takes effect even for popups
  that are already visible.
- **ANCS actions** (`BLUEFERRY_ANCS_ACTIONS`, off by default): action labels
  are app-defined content, so they are requested only while notification
  content is shown, only for non-Messages notifications that announce an
  action, shown only as popup buttons (markup characters removed), and never
  retained, logged, or broadcast. A phone action runs only after a click on its
  button, once per notification, and only for a UID announced in the current
  ANCS session; a session reset closes every popup that still carries buttons.
  There is no D-Bus method for it because clients never see ANCS notifications
  or UIDs.
- **Logs** exclude message bodies, notification text, one-time codes, and
  recipient identities at every level. Markup and terminal output are escaped
  at their display boundaries.
- **One-time codes** (opt-in `BLUEFERRY_OTP_AUTOCOPY`) go from the daemon
  straight to a clipboard helper's stdin, never to argv, the BlueFerry API,
  logs, or storage. The transient confirmation popup includes the code only
  when notification content is enabled. The daemon writes the clipboard
  itself: a background Wayland client needs a data-control helper such as
  `wl-copy`, and a GUI client would need the code over the bus.
- **Configuration** files are owner-only, size-bounded, opened without
  following final symlinks, and restricted to named settings. systemd never
  sources them as a process environment.
- **Trust boundary:** the Unix login session. Same-user processes can call
  the API and, while the wallet is unlocked, may be able to request its
  secrets. Encryption protects data at rest, not against a compromised
  session. Sandboxed clients need explicit access to the
  `io.weirdware.BlueFerry` name.

## Lifecycle and packaging

- The backend is a `Type=dbus` systemd user service that can be D-Bus
  activated. It is autostarted through a package-owned
  `default.target.wants` link and skipped by `ConditionPathExists` when no
  pairing configuration exists.
- Without systemd, `service_manager` treats the session bus as the service
  manager: start is D-Bus activation, and stop signals the same-user process
  the bus daemon reports as the name owner (SIGTERM, SIGKILL after 180
  seconds), then waits for the name to disappear. Only a running or enabled
  OpenRC user service (`packaging/openrc/blueferry`) on the desktop's own bus
  is driven through `rc-service --user`. Neither path has the unit's
  sandboxing.
- D-Bus is published before hardware work, and `GetStatus` reports
  `initializing` and degraded state explicitly.
- Packages install release and source-SHA markers. The daemon publishes them
  as `_build_id` and exits with status 75 when the markers change, so systemd
  (or OpenRC's supervisor) restarts it. Clients compare `_build_id` and fall
  back to a serialized restart. Package scripts never address other users'
  service managers.
- All external commands go through `commands.run_command`. Lifecycle tests
  replace marker reads and command runners, so they can never restart a real
  service.

## Tests

Parser, routing, retention, and lifecycle tests run without a live D-Bus, and
the harness rejects the real session and system buses. Presentation tests
inject fake clients. The Arch package check also runs one API round trip on a
private bus, validates desktop/AppStream metadata, lints the Kirigami and
Quickshell QML, and builds every split package. Architecture should depend
only on findings that stay reproducible in `PROTOCOL.md`.

## Growth rules

- Keep Bluetooth and storage ownership in the backend; do not duplicate that
  logic in toolkit clients.
- Keep cryptographic keys out of configuration, logs, D-Bus payloads, and
  presentation processes. Keyring lookup attributes are public metadata.
- Add protocol behavior behind the D-Bus boundary before adding UI controls.
- Change a versioned interface only compatibly and update the canonical XML and
  typed client models in the same patch; use a new suffix for incompatible
  changes. Keep `Events1` payloads content-free; private records remain behind
  unicast `Messages1` snapshot calls.
- Split `cli.py` or the Qt page module when a new feature would add another
  independent domain; avoid moving code solely to reduce line counts.
- Keep toolkit root files focused on navigation and composition. Put cohesive
  state derivation and presentation in loadable QML components with behavioral
  tests rather than growing root-level functions.
- Prefer narrowly tested helpers over broad exception handling. Best-effort
  cleanup may catch broadly, but command paths must return actionable errors.
