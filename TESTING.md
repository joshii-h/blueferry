# Testing

The automated suite must be safe to run on a desktop that has a paired,
connected iPhone. It never opens live BlueZ or OBEX connections, reads from a
phone, sends a message, changes pairing state, or talks to the installed
BlueFerry daemon or notification service.

`tests/conftest.py` enforces that boundary for ordinary tests by replacing the
session- and system-bus constructors with failures. Tests inject small fakes at
the I/O edge. The public D-Bus round-trip test is the sole exception: it runs
only when explicitly opted into a bus created from `tests/dbus-test.conf`.
That configuration has no service-activation directories, so it cannot start
installed desktop, Bluetooth, OBEX, notification, or BlueFerry services.

```sh
# Safe unit/contract suite; private-D-Bus test skips. The checkout's `src/`
# path is also pinned in pyproject.toml so an installed copy cannot win.
python -m pytest

# Full hermetic suite, including the public D-Bus round trip.
dbus-run-session --config-file=tests/dbus-test.conf -- sh -c '
  export BLUEFERRY_TEST_DBUS_ADDRESS="$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"
  export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS="$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"
  export PYTHONPATH=src
  python -m pytest
'
```

The repository quality workflow runs the same hermetic suite on Arch Linux,
along with Ruff, Bandit, mypy, QML linting, and a coverage report. The package
build remains the final split-package and desktop-metadata integration check.
The native package matrix also runs `packaging/smoke-qt.py` with the system
Python in isolated mode after installing the artifacts, on every target that
supports the Qt client. It loads the installed application and its default KDE
style with backend subscription and autostart disabled, an unavailable D-Bus
address, and temporary XDG directories. Missing Python bindings, QML files, or
style dependencies fail this check even when CLI/TUI startup still succeeds.

## What belongs in the suite

- Protocol tests use inert strings or captured, reviewed fixtures and assert
  exact parsing or wire-format behavior.
- Hypothesis tests generate malformed and boundary-shaped bMessage, vCard,
  ANCS, recipient, and group-correlation input. They call pure functions only,
  use deterministic settings, and remain behind the same fatal D-Bus guard.
- Security tests assert trust boundaries and adversarial inputs.
- Storage tests inject deterministic in-memory key providers. They never load
  libsecret, contact GNOME Keyring/KWallet, create wallet entries, display an
  unlock prompt, or inspect the user's encrypted BlueFerry databases.
- Lifecycle and concurrency tests assert externally meaningful outcomes, not
  private call order unless the order itself prevents a leak or race.
- The eight classes with a `schedule`/`cancel` seam (`AdapterClassSupervisor`,
  `AncsClient`, `BearerSupervisor`, `BluetoothRecovery`, `EventDispatcher`,
  `MnsWatch`, `ProfileSupervisor`, `SolicitationSupervisor`) get both fakes
  injected in tests, and `BluetoothRecovery` also its `idle` fake. Their GLib
  defaults are bound at import time, so patching `GLib` does not replace them.
  The autouse `glib_source_guard` in `tests/conftest.py` fails any test that
  leaves a GLib timer or idle source armed, because it would fire later on an
  orphaned object inside an unrelated test.
- Private-bus tests open their own connections with
  `tests.private_bus.open_private_bus`, which disables libdbus's
  exit-on-disconnect. Otherwise a closed connection that a failing test keeps
  alive makes the next GLib iteration exit pytest with status 1 and no report.
  `tests/conftest.py` rejects `dbus.SessionBus(private=True)` and
  `dbus.SystemBus(private=True)` called directly from test code.
- Daemon tests build a real `Daemon` with the `make_daemon` fixture, which
  isolates every state path, and replace only hardware-facing collaborators.
  Never assemble one with `Daemon.__new__` and hand-set private fields.
  Behavior that has its own class, such as `ContactSync`, is tested directly.
- Packaging tests keep runtime identifiers and installed metadata consistent.
  `test_potfiles.py` requires every module importing `blueferry.i18n` and
  every QML file calling `qsTr()` to be listed in `po/POTFILES.in`.
- A test should remain valid if the implementation is rewritten without
  changing the behavior it protects.

Real-device experiments are manual development work, never automated test work.
They require the operator to understand the exact action being performed;
outgoing-message experiments require a deliberately chosen recipient and
must not be hidden behind an automated test command.

`test_dbus_contract.py` compares the shipped introspection XML with the
dbus-python decorators, including signatures and stable application errors.
Private D-Bus tests deliberately hold fake wallet and conversation-projection
work open while fetching status, and verify that history changes invalidate
an in-flight projection. Wallet tests cover cancellation and late key results;
group tests bind confirmation to the displayed roster across client refreshes.
Named-group upgrade tests separate previously colliding spellings and exercise
legacy rosters, stars, read state, reply confirmation, and deletion against
temporary history. Ambiguous old keys must fail without sending or deleting
another conversation; replaying projected history must not enable an old
ambiguous route.
Fresh-profile integration coverage starts with locked storage and missing
databases, unlocks a fake wallet, and reads the first retained message through
the compatibility-checking client. Client tests reject incompatible API
generations before operations, including after daemon replacement; lifecycle
tests verify that packaged upgrade recovery runs before compatibility checks.
Client-model and setup-facade tests use plain mappings and monkeypatched
operations; they must not probe BlueZ merely to exercise serialization.
Pairing-helper IPC tests substitute inert Python subprocesses with real pipes.
They cover exit during confirmation, failed writes and flushes, retained error
reports, bounded recovery, and stream cleanup with a full output queue. These
subprocesses never invoke the actual pairing helper or access Bluetooth.
Read-receipt tests use a fake clock and inert OBEX worker to verify that local
reads remain immediate, phone reads wait for the ANCS grace period, and late
group metadata still joins the message. Reconnects and shutdown must discard
pending phone acknowledgements instead of reusing stale message handles,
including between writes in an active batch. A full OBEX worker must retain
and retry unsubmitted acknowledgements without shortening newer reads' delay.
Shared conversation tests exercise partial failures and recovery in either order,
and reject stale recipient approvals even when the backend remembers the new
roster. Presentation tests feed the same derived thread metadata through Qt and
Quickshell and retain adapter coverage for delayed confirmation dialogs.
Bluetooth compatibility tests feed inert `btmgmt info` text through the parser
and fake BlueZ's object inventory. They assert capabilities rather than
controller brands and never execute `btmgmt` against the host.
The GTK client worker test replaces both the bus and GLib handoff, while the
Kirigami controller test disables QDBus subscription and autostart. QML lint
and offscreen loads may construct presentation objects only with an
injected inert controller; a GUI smoke test must never use the default
controller because that would activate the installed backend.
Qt settings tests load the real main window with a QML recorder that cannot
perform I/O. They exercise first-run navigation, repeated page reopening,
device selection and busy state, storage-status recovery, and confirmation
across refreshes or settings closure. Binding warnings fail these tests;
pairing and storage actions must reach the recorder only after confirmation.

Quickshell setup tests load the real controller without a transport and inject
helper replies. They cover first install, adapter changes, cancellation, failed
and malformed results, confirmation lifetime, replacement snapshots, and late
configuration reads after pairing/unpairing. The settings page uses that inert
controller; palette tests load only `ThemePalette.qml`. A private-bus test runs
the real Quickshell transport with temporary Python helpers to exercise streamed
prompts, stdin, exit status, cancellation, and a missing executable. It skips
when Quickshell is unavailable. Visual previews replace both transports and
the host theme loader before loading the shell; never preview with live helpers.
Each Quickshell subprocess test supplies a temporary runtime directory with
mode 0700, so it also works for unprivileged builders without a login session.
A shell test uses those inert replacements to verify direct replies after saving
group members, blocking during edits or roster review, and the exact roster token
sent with each reply. Backend tests reject that token after the members change.
The shell test also delivers pre-save snapshots and failures before or after
the fresh snapshot, verifies immediate replies use the saved roster, and checks
that interrupted reads cannot restore history after a reset.

The Arch package check runs Ruff over the complete source and test tree,
Bandit over the Python security boundaries, and type-checks every backend
module with mypy. Toolkit clients remain outside that
broad type-checking pass because their dynamically generated GObject and Qt
APIs have little useful static type information; their pure presenters and
models retain focused tests instead.
