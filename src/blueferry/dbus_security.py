"""Caller validation and abuse limits for the private session-bus API.

The session bus is still a same-Unix-user trust boundary. These checks prevent
cross-user access on unusually configured buses and bound accidental or
malicious request floods; they do not claim to authenticate native apps that
run under the daemon owner's UID.
